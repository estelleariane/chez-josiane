                <P> About </P>
                <p>
                    Sewing has always been a <i><b>passion</b></i>  and as far as i can remember, it all started as a hobby.
                    I was always attracted by fashion and will use all opportunity i have to add my personnal
                    touch to almost every piece of garment i can put my hand on. i started by styling my dolls
                    and before i knew it i was making clothes for my frineds and family. Before long, through word of 
                    mouth i was having actual customers. That is when i decided to take some classes and turn my passion 
                    into business.
